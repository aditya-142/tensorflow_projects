# CNN Projects using tensorflow

This repository contains a collection of projects on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Projects

I. **Image classification:** This project uses CNNs to classify images of different objects.
  * Built a customised model using keras and tensorflow for classification of images.
  [The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) contains images of 6 different categories: 'glacier', 'buildings', 'street', 'mountain', 'forest'& 'sea'.

II. **Transfer learning:** This project uses CNNs that have been pre-trained on a large dataset to classify images of new objects.
  * For this project the dataset used was [The Eurosat Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apollo2506/eurosat-dataset). Dataset contains the following ten class folders AnnualCrop, Forest, HerbaceousVegatation,   Highway, Industrial, Pasture, PermanentCrop, Residential, River, SeaLake.
  * The CNN used for transfer learning is DenseNet201. DenseNet201 has 201 layers and is one of the best cnn for image classification.
